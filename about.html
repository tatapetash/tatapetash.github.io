				<h2> Basic Photography tips & tricks </h2>
				<p> Photography is a part of our everyday life. It's a fact. Even if we are not professional photographers or not even amateurs we still keep shooting common events, papers, our fiends and family, and etc. However, if you are interested in deepening your knowladge in photography and want it be a part of you and your personality, there are some tricks you should most definetly know! </p>
				<p> I am a begginer photgrapher, just like you are! However, throught my work I found out theat there are three main photography basics: SHUTTER SPEED, ISO, and APATURE, which will make your photography skills better if you know how to use them in the right setting.</p>

					<h3> SHUTTER SPEED </h3>
					<p> when it comes to sports photography or any other in which it is super important to capture a moving object/subject still, SHUTTER SPEED is the most important setting.</p>
					<p> Of course it matters whether the lighting is good or bad when we want to capture a moment but at this point our main goal is to get a still picture. TO do that the shutter speed should be at least 300, otherwise the picture might be blury or not clear. Perfect setting for that would be if the shutter speed was 360, just like in the picture, where every single deatail is perfectly still and explicit.</p>
					<p> So, basically what shutter speed is doing is that it closes the lense fast enough to get a perfect shot.</p>

							<h4> ISO </h4>

							<p> In photography, ISO measures sensitivity of the picture.ISO is the main setting for the good lighting. When it comes to shooting portraint, the more of the ISO you use, the better it is. </p>

				<p>APATURE</p>
				<h5>when it comes to taking pictures of a landscape, shutter speed and ISO is important as well. Whith high ISO and shutter speed you can freeze the moment and shot the best view possible. The combination of those to create apature, which makes sure that there is a focus on a certain object but also has a good visibiity to the background and other objects are not blury.</h5>
				<h6>So, basically apature controls shutter speed and ISO for the larger views.</h6>
